Budget uses Vagrant for development to make installation simple. Please install Vagrant for this purpose. Otherwise, please refer to the /provision.sh script to understand dependencies required for other installations.

```
$ vagrant up
```

Add the following to /etc/hosts

```
192.168.33.20     budget.vagrant
```

NPM and Bower are used to manage assets:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Assets

To make Gulp run everytime a scss/css/js file is saved:

```
$ gulp watch
```

## Testing

```
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /var/www/budget/website
$ APPLICATION_ENV=vagranttest ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/
```

When writing new tests, some custom controller assertions have been added:

```php
$this->assertQuery('form#register', (string)$response->getBody());
$this->assertQueryCount('ul.errors li', 3, (string)$response->getBody());
```
